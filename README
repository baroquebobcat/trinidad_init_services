Trinidad daemon
===============

Trinidad's daemon library based on Apache Commons Daemon and JRuby-jsvc. Works on Unix and Windows systems.

Installation
============

$ jruby -S gem install trinidad_daemon

When the gem is installed the user must launch the installation process:

    $ jruby -S trinidad_daemon_install

This installer guides you through the configuration process and generates a
init.d script if you are on a unix system or creates the service if you are
on a windows box.

Unix
====

  Dependencies
  ============

  The Jsvc native binary file is required, but it's already available for all the
  platforms supported as a bundled package, i.e:

      Debian/Ubuntu:
          $ sudo apt-get install jsvc
      Mac OS X:
          $ brew install jsvc

  Those binaries are also available in the Apache distribution directory, if
  you install it from this directory you must ensure it's in your path:

  http://www.apache.org/dist/commons/daemon/binaries/

  Execution
  =========

  When the installation process finishes you can use the script trinidad-daemon.sh
  generated to launch the server as a daemon with the options start|stop|restart,
  i.e:

      $ /etc/init.d/trinidad restart

Windows
=======

  Execution
  =========

  Open the `Services` panel under `Administrative Tools` and look for a
  service called `Trinidad`.
