Trinidad daemon
===============

Trinidad's daemon library based on Apache Commons Daemon and JRuby-jsvc.

It should replace the daemon_extension in a near future due to the problem we
are finding with the current forking process.

Dependencies
============

The Jsvc native binary file is required, but it's already available for all the
platforms supported as a bundled package, i.e:

    Debian/Ubuntu:
        $ sudo apt-get install jsvc
    Mac OS X:
        $ brew install jsvc

Those binaries are also available in the Apache distribution directory, if
you install it from this directory you must ensure it's in your path:

http://www.apache.org/dist/commons/daemon/binaries/1.0.3/

Installation
============

When the gem is installed the user must launch the installation process:

    $ jruby -S trinidad_daemon_install

This installer guides you through the configuration process and generates a
init.d script for your platform.

Execution
=========

When the installation process finishes you can use the script trinidad-daemon.sh
generated to launch the server as a daemon with the options start|stop|restart,
i.e:

    $ /etc/init.d/trinidad-daemon.sh restart
